# train exif this way

I obtained this image from Flickr recently. Unfortunately, I lost the initial file which included metadata such as GPS information. I need to find the author (first name) who posted this photo on Flickr and GPS in the original photo.

Flag format: YCEP24{author-GPSLat-GPSLong} [all lower case]

Example: 

Author first name: Arthur  
GPS-Latitude: 1_18_35.193_N, GPS Longitude: 105_51_19.0794_E

You should submit: YCEP24{arthur-1_18_35.193_N-105_51_19.0794_E}
