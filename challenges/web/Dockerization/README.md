# Dockerization

Running the challenges locally is a great way to figure out what's going on.
Most web challenges provide Dockerfiles to get the challenge up and running
on your machine. The objective is simple: download Docker and deploy this
challenge on your computer to get the flag - unless you love torture and
decide to reverse engineer the shared object file instead.
