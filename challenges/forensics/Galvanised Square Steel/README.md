# Galvanised Square Steel
Little John decided he had enough of working his life away to afford rent for such a tiny apartment. To get his galvanised square steel and eco-friendly wood veneer, he decided to become a hacker and steal money from the rich. However, he isn't very good at hiding his tracks. 3 pieces of evidence were easily found on the computer he compromised. 

Find the 3 pieces of evidence and the house is yours.

Flag format: `YCEP24{part1` + `part2` + `part3` + `}` 
FYI for forming the flag: `part2` starts with an `f`.
