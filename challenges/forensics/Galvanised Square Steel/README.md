# Galvanised Square Steel
Little John decided he had enough of working his life away to afford rent for such a tiny apartment. To get his galvanised square steel and eco-friendly wood veneer, he decided to become a hacker and steal money from the rich. However, he isn't very good at hiding his tracks. 3 pieces of evidence were easily found on the computer he compromised. 

Find the 3 pieces of evidence and the house is yours.

Flag format: `YCEP24{part1` + `part2` + `part3` + `}` 
FYI for forming the flag: `part2` starts with an `f`.

## Hints
- Little John is really TERRIBLE at hiding his tracks. It's not helping his case that he loves to use the command line. (50 points)
- Little John LOVES fragmented files. He also loves naming his files practically, something like... hmm... partone? parttwo? no? (100 points)
- Little John doesn't know how to use secure passwords for his accounts! Pray he doesn't get his password cracked.  (200 points)
