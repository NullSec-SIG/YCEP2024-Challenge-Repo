# Excel, My Beloved
An excel file is just a zip file of multiple XML documents. Each XML document corresponds to one spreadsheet in the Excel file. So actually, an xlsx file is just a glorified zip file in a way. So if you unzip an excel file, you can see all the goods inside. 
Turn the Excel file into a zip file, unzip it and you can see this very suspicious file, Flag.txt
