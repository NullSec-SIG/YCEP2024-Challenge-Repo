# shiftin' shenanigans

The given Python function scrambles the flag by swapping all the even and odd characters. Players are given the scrambled flag after it has been scrambled with the function.

## Solution
just make a function that does the opposite i.e. swaps all the characters back to their original places (they could also solve it on paper if they figure out how it works but i made the flag kinda long)
