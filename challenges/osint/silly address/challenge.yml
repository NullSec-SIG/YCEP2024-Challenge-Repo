  description: "A crazy hacker decided to STEAL my laptop and hack into it to exfiltrate all my data!! Luckily, the hacker's behaviour got captured through the company's detection program. I found the BSSID (c4:e2:87:d3:3a:71) of the network that the hacker was connected to. Help me find the SSID please!!!!! Flag format: YCEP24{SSID}, for e.g., if the SSID is Wirelink@NgeeAnnPoly, the flag is YCEP24{Wirelink@NgeeAnnPoly}."
