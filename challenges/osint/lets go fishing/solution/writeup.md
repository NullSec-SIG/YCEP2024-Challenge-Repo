## lets go fishing

Objective: to find the most suspicious looking element in the email

## 1) look at the email address.
- Check for poor grammar, spelling mistakes, and awkward phrasing
- Be cautious of urgent language that prompts immediate action (e.g., "Your account will be suspended if you don't click this link now"). etc.

## 2) look at the links
- Check if the links looks legit? phishers often use domain names that closely resemble real ones but have slight misspellings or additional characters
- does it come from reputable company? gmail, outlook, hotmail, yahoo, etc.
