# Baby Crypto Solution

1. Use [dcode.fr](https://www.dcode.fr/cipher-identifier) to identify the cipher used in the challenge. It results in ROT/Caesar Cipher.
2. Given the hint in the challenge description, pick the Caesar Cipher and decrypt (bruteforce) to get the flag. 
3. The flag is `YCEP24{e4t_s0m3_s414d_f0r_gD_h341th}`. ROT would work too.
